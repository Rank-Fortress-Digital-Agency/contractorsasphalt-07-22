                    1. Seal your driveway
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sealing your driveway is one of the best ways to protect it from the elements and prevent cracking and other damage. You should fill your driveway every one to three years, depending on the climate in your area and the condition of your driveway. Sealing your driveway is a relatively simple process, but it does require some preparation and special equipment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before you begin, sweep or pressure wash your driveway to remove any dirt, dust, or debris. Once it’s clean, let it dry completely. Next, fill any cracks or holes with an asphalt patch or sealant. Once the patch or sealant is dry, you’re ready to begin sealing.
                </p>

                            2. Remove stains promptly
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Stains from oil, gasoline, and other substances can damage your driveway if they’re not removed promptly. Use a degreaser or another type of cleaner specifically designed for removing these types of stains.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Be sure to rinse the area thoroughly after cleaning it. You may need to repeat the process a few times to remove the stain. If the stain is particularly stubborn, you may need a power washer. Be careful not to damage the concrete while using a power washer.
                        </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Power washing your driveway periodically will remove any build-up of dirt, grime, and other substances. This will help keep it looking clean and new and can also help to extend its lifespan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a <A href="https://www.contractorsasphalt.com/services/concrete-wheel-stops-car-stops/">concrete driveway</A>, power washing is essential. Concrete is a very porous material that can easily absorb stains and dirt. Power washing will remove any deep-seated dirt, grime, and surface-level stains. This will leave your driveway looking clean and new.

                            Driving on the edges of your driveway can damage the asphalt and cause it to crack. So, it’s essential to avoid doing this.

                        <p>
                            Asphalt is an excellent option if you’re looking for a durable and long-lasting driveway. However, taking care of your asphalt driveway is important to ensure it lasts. One way to do this is by avoiding driving on the edges of your driveway. This can damage the asphalt and cause it to crack.

                    8. Don’t use salt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Salt can damage your driveway and hasten the deterioration of the asphalt. So, it’s best to avoid using it altogether. If you must use salt, be sure to use it sparingly and wash it off as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a concrete driveway, you’re in luck. Salt won’t damage concrete the way it does asphalt. However, it can still cause problems. For one, salt can make your concrete slippery, a hazard for anyone walking on it. Additionally, salt can cause your concrete to pit and flake. To avoid these problems, use salt sparingly and wash it off as soon as possible.

                    9. Be careful with chemicals
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chemicals such as antifreeze and oil can damage your driveway if they spill. So, be sure to clean up any spills immediately. And, if you must store these kinds of chemicals in your garage, be sure to do so safely and securely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another potential hazard to your driveway is salt. During the winter, many people use salt to melt ice and snow on their driveways. However, salt can damage concrete and asphalt over time. So, if you use salt on your driveway, brush it off as soon as possible. And try to use a salt alternative when possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ensure your driveway is regularly inspected and repaired as needed. Over time, all driveways will suffer from wear and tear. By having your driveway inspected and repaired regularly, you can help to extend its lifespan.

                    10. Call in a professional
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you’re not confident in adequately maintaining your driveway, it’s best to call in a professional. They have the experience and expertise to get the job done right, and they can also offer suggestions on the best products to use for your particular driveway. You can find a reputable professional by asking friends, family, or neighbors for recommendations, or you can search online for customer reviews.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you’ve found a professional you’re comfortable with, get a written estimate of the work to be done and ask about any warranties that may be available. In most cases, a good driveway sealing professional will offer a warranty on their work. This can give you peace of mind knowing that your investment is protected.
